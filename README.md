Llama

Llama is a very poor man's Camel. Seriously go use camel, its better in basically every way, except for the ways outlined here. I like Camel, gosh I've copied a huge amount of ideas from them. But, I think we can do a little better sometimes with a little less.

What is Llama

Well llama is a bit like camel, though currently it is only annotation driven. It allows for specialized protocols such as JMS and File and maybe others to be used without a lot of headache.
